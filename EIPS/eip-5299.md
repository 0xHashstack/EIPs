## Abstract
Upgrading a storage layout is required in case of a complex project if it is re-architected. The EIP introduces dynamic storage slots, which can be upgraded without deploying a new contract.

## Motivation
With the existing smart contract upgradable design patterns available, while itâ€™s possible to upgrade the code implementation, it is not possible to completely upgrade the storage structure, which requires a re-deployment of the contracts.

From the end-user perspective, it is annoying to migrate from an old version of an app to a new version, especially if it requires deploying multiple transactions.


## Specification
This EIP is an extension of [EIP-2535](./eip-2535.md), adding a mechanism that maintains the old data points and enabling the possibility to update the structure of storage struct while updating the implementation.

### Layer3 scaling standard
For upgrading a storage structure we will store the slot addresses in a special struct we will call it ParentStorage and then retrieve the slot whenever the specific facet interacts with data store.

Here is a simple example that shows dynamic slot based storage and its use in one of the implementation contract:

```solidity
// A contract that implements Parent Storage and Implementation contract storage.
library LibA {

    // This struct contains state variables related to diamond
    struct ParentStorage {
        address owner;
    }

    // This struct contains state variables related to specific implementation contract
    struct AppStorageV1 {
        bytes32 dataA;
    }

    // Returns the struct from a specified position in contract storage
    // ps is short for ParentStorage
    function parentStorage() internal pure returns(ParentStorage storage ps) {
        bytes32 storagePosition = keccak256("parent.storage");
        // Set the position of our struct in contract storage
        assembly {ps.slot := storagePosition}
    }

    // Returns the struct from a specified position in contract storage
    // as is short for AppStorage
    function appStorageV1() internal pure returns(AppStorageV1 storage as) {
        // The identifier must be unique for a implementation contract
        bytes32 storagePosition = keccak256("app.storage.implContractA.V1");
        assembly {as.slot := storagePosition}
    }
}

// Our implementation contract uses the Parent Storage defined above along with the implementation contract specific storage
contract ImplContractAV1 {
    function setDataA(bytes32 _dataA) external {
        LibA.ParentStorage storage ds = LibA.parentStorage();
        LibA.AppStorageV1 storage as = LibA.appStorageV1();
        require(ds.owner == msg.sender, "Must be owner.");
        as.dataA = _dataA;
    }

    function getDataA() external view returns (bytes32) {
        LibA.AppStorageV1 storage as = LibA.appStorageV1();
        return as.dataA;
    }
}
```

Now that we have unique slot position for our implementation contract in place, we will modify the storage structure and introduce a new slot position for the same and upgrade the contract by using a function which will add the new function from below implementation contract. The function updates the mapping of function selector to implementation contract address.

```solidity
// A contract that implements Parent Storage and Implementation contract storage.
library LibB {

    // This struct contains state variables related to diamond
    struct ParentStorage {
        address owner;
    }

    // This struct contains state variables related to specific 
    struct AppStorageV1 {
        bytes32 dataA;
    }

    // Upgraded struct
    struct AppStorageV2 {
        uint256 dataA;
    }

    // Returns the struct from a specified position in contract storage
    // ps is short for DiamondStorage
    function parentStorage() internal pure returns(ParentStorage storage ps) {
        bytes32 storagePosition = keccak256("parent.storage");
        // Set the position of our struct in contract storage
        assembly {ps.slot := storagePosition}
    }

    // Returns the struct from a specified position in contract storage
    // as is short for AppStorage
    function appStorageV1() internal pure returns(AppStorageV1 storage as) {
        bytes32 storagePosition = keccak256("app.storage.implContractA.V1");
        assembly {as.slot := storagePosition}
    }

    // Returns the struct from a specified position in contract storage
    // as is short for AppStorage
    function appStorageV2() internal pure returns(AppStorageV2 storage as) {
        bytes32 storagePosition = keccak256("app.storage.implContractA.V2");
        assembly {as.slot := storagePosition}
    }
}

// Our implementation contract uses the Parent Storage defined above along with the implementation contract specific storage
contract ImplContractAV2 {
    function setDataAV2(uint256 _dataA) external {
        LibB.DiamondStorage storage ds = LibA.parentStorage();
        LibB.AppStorageV2 storage as = LibA.appStorageV2();
        require(ds.owner == msg.sender, "Must be owner.");
        as.dataA = _dataA;
  }

    function getDataAV2() external view returns (uint256) {
        LibB.AppStorageV2 storage as = LibA.appStorageV2();
        return as.dataA;
    }

    function getDataAV1AndV2() external view returns (bytes32, uint256) {
        LibB.AppStorageV1 storage as1 = LibA.appStorageV1();
        LibB.AppStorageV2 storage as2 = LibA.appStorageV2();
        return (as1.dataA, as2.dataA);
    }
}

```
With above implementation, we will have access to both AppStorageV1 and AppStorageV2 which can be used either for migration or used in conjunction as per the use case.

## Rationale
WIP


## Backwards Compatibility
This standard makes scaling smart contract storage compatible with the future standards & functionality because the storage slots can be added dynamically to enable storage expansion, while also facilitating a means to retrieve and store data across various legacy & in-production storage contracts.


## Test Cases
[Test cases](../assets/eip-5299/Layer3-scaling-standard/test)


## Reference Implementation
[Reference implementation](../assets/eip-5299/Layer3-scaling-standard)


## Security Considerations
A storage selector clash occurs when two different storage slot addresses point to the same location. This has the unintended consequence of overriding data. This scenario is not possible with the `diamondCut` function described in ([EIP-2535](./eip-2535.md)), because it uses the contract address of facets to generate the slot address.
